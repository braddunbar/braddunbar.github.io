      Hey, I'm Brad, a husband, dad, javascripter and enjoyer of
      peanut butter sandwiches (preferably with honey and raisins).

      As a programmer, I primarily write javascript. I &lt;3 it. Function
      scoped hugs and object literal kisses for everyone! I write mostly for
      the browser but I also have plenty of experience on the other side of the
      pipe.

      Ah, the beautiful substrate of the web(!). Finding more semantically
      correct ways to express content is a constantly evolving task for which I
      seem to have no lack of enthusiasm. I'm certainly into the new shiny
      HTML5 niceties, but sometimes things should just be simple. I'm ok with
      that and I actually think it's pretty great sometimes.

      Other than javascript, Writing cross browser style sheets is probably
      where I have the most experience. I've dealt with peekaboo bugs, IE
      hacks, and replaced table layouts with huge amounts of divs *cough*.

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      I've been working as a full time programmer since graduating in 2007.
      I've worked with many great people and fun projects and they just get
      better and better!
    </p>

    <h3>FrontEnd Developer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong><a target='_blank' href='http://getharvest.com'>Harvest</a></strong>
      <em>Oct 2014 - Present</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      These days I'm applying my skills to time tracking and invoicing. The
      team at Harvest is kind, professional, and very good at what they do. I'm
      struggling a bit to keep up but I think things are starting to even out!
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel as though I've swapped jobs enough at this point and I hope to
      hang my hat at Harvest for a long time to come.
    </p>

    <h3>FrontEnd Engineer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong><a target='_blank' href='http://pathable.com'>Pathable</a></strong>
      <em>Jun 2011 - Oct 2014</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      At Pathable, I hacked to create a community and social network for
      conferences and events through coffeescript. I also enjoyed the
      opportunity to dig into ruby and rails, something I'd wanted to do for a
      long while.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by far the best environment for writing code I'd ever worked in.
      The people I worked with were very talented and it barely felt like work
      at all.
    </p>

    <h3>Senior Developer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <a target='_blank' href='http://geninfo.com/'>General Information Systems</a>
      </strong>
      <em>Nov 2010 - Jun 2011</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I helped to streamline a rather large javascript codebase, along with a
      good helping of backend development using an MVC paradigm. I also helped
      out other developers who didn't have much experience writing javascript.
    </p>

    <h3>Lead Developer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <a target='_blank' href='http://cgmcc.com/'>CGM Computer Consulting</a>
      </strong>
      <em>Oct 2008 - Nov 2010</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the primary developer, I created a custom CMS for the Basic Combat
      Training unit at Fort Jackson SC. Since I was the only developer, I
      learned a great deal about cleaning up my own messes and just making
      things work.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Developer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <a target='_blank' href='http://seibels.com/'>Seibels Insurance</a>
      </strong>
      <em>Sep 2007 - Oct 2008</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      While working at Seibels, I found new languages and refined my
      understanding of javascript. I also met lots of friendly people and
      shipped a bunch of code.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Developer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <a target='_blank' href='http://scana.com/'>SCANA Services</a>
      </strong>
      <em>Mar 2006 - Sep 2007</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      As an intern, and later a full time employee, I did a great deal of
      reading and learning. My primary realization was that going to school
      had given me approximately 1% of the knowledge I would need to be a
      successful programmer.
