      Hey, I'm Brad, a husband, dad, javascripter and enjoyer of
      peanut butter sandwiches (preferably with honey and raisins).

      As a programmer, I primarily write javascript. I &lt;3 it. Function
      scoped hugs and object literal kisses for everyone! I write mostly for
      the browser but I also have plenty of experience on the other side of the
      pipe.

      Ah, the beautiful substrate of the web(!). Finding more semantically
      correct ways to express content is a constantly evolving task for which I
      seem to have no lack of enthusiasm. I'm certainly into the new shiny
      HTML5 niceties, but sometimes things should just be simple. I'm ok with
      that and I actually think it's pretty great sometimes.

      Other than javascript, Writing cross browser style sheets is probably
      where I have the most experience. I've dealt with peekaboo bugs, IE
      hacks, and replaced table layouts with huge amounts of divs *cough*.

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      I've been working as a full time programmer since 2007. Here are some
      highlights.
    </p>

    <h3>Senior Engineer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong><a target='_blank' href='http://getharvest.com'>Harvest</a></strong>
      <em>Oct 2014 - Present</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been working at Harvest for quite a while now. It's a great place
      to work because of the great people that work there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvest customers value stability, and I've learned a lot about how to
      evolve and improve a service without interrupting its users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of all, I've learned about working on a team and how important it
      is to keep that top of mind. The trust of your teammates is always more
      valuable than the solution you choose or its execution. 
    </p>

    <h3>FrontEnd Engineer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong><a target='_blank' href='http://pathable.com'>Pathable</a></strong>
      <em>Jun 2011 - Oct 2014</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was my first fully remote position, which required a lot of adjustment.
      I had to learn to create boundaries around my workday and develop strategies
      for dealing with burnout.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went from writing C# to writing Ruby along with a change from Windows
      to Macos. Learning Ruby and Rails was eye opening and changed my perspective
      on a great many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also did a lot of open source work on
      <a href='https://backbonejs.org/' target='_blank'>Backbone</a>
      and
      <a href='https://underscorejs.org/' target='_blank'>Underscore</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Senior Developer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <a target='_blank' href='http://geninfo.com/'>General Information Systems</a>
      </strong>
      <em>Nov 2010 - Jun 2011</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I helped to streamline a rather large javascript codebase, along with a
      good helping of backend development. I also helped out other developers who
      didn't have much experience writing javascript.
    </p>

    <h3>Lead Developer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <a target='_blank' href='http://www.cgmcc.com/'>CGM Computer Consulting</a>
      </strong>
      <em>Oct 2008 - Nov 2010</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the primary developer, I created a custom CMS for the Basic Combat
      Training unit at Fort Jackson SC. Since I was the only developer, I
      learned a great deal about cleaning up my own messes and just making
      things work.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Developer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <a target='_blank' href='http://seibels.com/'>Seibels Insurance</a>
      </strong>
      <em>Sep 2007 - Oct 2008</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      While working at Seibels, I found new languages and refined my
      understanding of javascript. I also met lots of friendly people and
      shipped a bunch of code.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Developer</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCANA'>SCANA Services</a>
      </strong>
      <em>Mar 2006 - Sep 2007</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      As an intern, and later a full time employee, I did a great deal of
      reading and learning. My primary realization was that going to school
      had given me approximately 1% of the knowledge I would need to be a
      successful programmer.
