        Hey! Iʼm Brad. Iʼm an engineer that understands that teams run on
        trust. Without the trust of your teammates, itʼs very difficult to
        accomplish your goals. Building trust requires spending enjoyable time
        together, so thatʼs how I like to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, I understand that code is for people first and computers
        second. Of course your code should be readable by a computer, but if
        you canʼt use it to build a shared theory of the system then itʼs worth
        very little.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you also value the trust of your co-workers above the specific
        solution used to solve a problem then we can probably do great things
        together.
      </p>

          <span>Senior Software Engineer</span>
          <p>
            Harvest customers value stability, and Iʼve learned a lot about how
            to evolve and improve a service without interrupting its users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of all, Iʼve learned about working on a team and how important
            it is to keep that top of mind. The trust of your teammates is
            always more valuable than the solution you choose or its execution.

          <span>Frontend Engineer</span>
          <p>
            This was my first fully remote position, which required a lot of
            adjustment. I had to learn to create boundaries around my workday
            and develop strategies for dealing with burnout.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went from writing C# to writing Ruby along with a change from
            Windows to Macos. Learning Ruby and Rails was eye opening and
            changed my perspective on a great many things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also did a lot of open source work on
            <a href='https://backbonejs.org/' target='_blank'>Backbone</a>
            and
            <a href='https://underscorejs.org/' target='_blank'>Underscore</a>.

          <h3>General Information Systems</h3>
          <span>Senior Developer</span>
          <p>
            I helped to streamline a rather large javascript codebase, along
            with a good helping of backend development. I also helped out other
            developers who didnʼt have much experience writing javascript.

          <h3>CGM Computer Consulting</h3>
          <span>Lead Developer</span>
          <p>
            As the primary developer, I created a custom CMS for the Basic
            Combat Training unit at Fort Jackson SC. Since I was the only
            developer, I learned a great deal about cleaning up my own messes
            and just making things work.

          <span>Web Developer</span>
          <p>
            While working at Seibels, I found new languages and refined my
            understanding of javascript. I also met lots of friendly people and
            shipped a bunch of code.

          <span>Web Developer</span>
          <p>
            As an intern, and later a full time employee, I did a great deal of
            reading and learning. My primary realization was that going to
            school had given me approximately 1% of the knowledge I would need
            to be a successful programmer.
