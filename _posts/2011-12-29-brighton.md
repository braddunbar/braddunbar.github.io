It's official. I'm a father now. My daughter was born on Thursday, December
22<sup>nd</sup> 2011 weighing in at 7 lbs 6 oz and measuring 19.25 inches long.
I've never been so happy or exhausted before in my life. My wife was amazing
throughout the pregnancy and birth and our family has been incredibly loving
and supportive in every way imaginable. Life will never be the same.
