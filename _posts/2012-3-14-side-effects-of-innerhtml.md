title: Side Effects of innerHTML

Today I learned (after a long and arduous debugging session) that `innerHTML`
can have serious side effects when used in Internet Explorer. Consider the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
var p = document.createElement('p');
p.innerHTML = '<a>test</a>';
a = p.childNodes[0];
p.innerHTML = '';
console.log(a.innerHTML);
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a [fiddle][fiddle] in case you want to play around with it. In most
modern browsers this snippet will happily log `'test'` before continuing about
it's business. Internet Explorer, on the other hand, will remove the contents
of `a` when setting `p.innerHTML` and log the empty string to the console.
Obviously this can lead to some interesting results if you're not expecting it.
Hopefully I've saved you the debugging time I've lost today. ;)

I filed [a bug][bug] concerning this behavior on the jQuery issue tracker,
but it can't be fixed due to performance considerations (more details in
[the ticket][bug]). That said, working around the issue by using
`.empty().append(â€¦)` is easy to do.
